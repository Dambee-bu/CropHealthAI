CropHealthAI ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–
CropHealthAI is a machine learning-powered application designed to help farmers, agricultural researchers, and plant health experts detect and diagnose diseases in crops with high accuracy. By leveraging a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, CropHealthAI can identify the health status and diseases of key crops like corn, pepper, and tomato based on leaf images.

Key Features:
Disease Detection: Accurately identifies common diseases affecting corn, pepper, and tomato crops.
User-Friendly Interface: Upload a leaf image to get instant predictions on the crop's health status or disease type.
AI-Driven Insights: Utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to analyze and classify diseases.
Wide Coverage: Detects a variety of diseases including bacterial spots, blights, and viral infections.
Supported Crop Classes:
Corn (Maize):
Healthy
Cercospora Leaf Spot (Gray Leaf Spot)
Common Rust
Northern Leaf Blight
Pepper (Bell):
Healthy
Bacterial Pepper Spot
Tomato:
Healthy
Bacterial Spot
Early Blight
Late Blight
Leaf Mold
Septoria Leaf Spot
Spider Mites (Two-Spotted Spider Mite)
Target Spot
Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
Tomato Mosaic Virus
How It Works:
Upload a clear image of the crop leaf.
CropHealthAI analyzes the image using its trained model.
The app returns the detected health status or disease along with the confidence level of the prediction.

Why CropHealthAI?
Agricultural productivity is often hindered by plant diseases that can spread rapidly if not identified early. CropHealthAI provides a fast, reliable, and cost-effective solution to aid farmers and agricultural professionals in making timely decisions to improve crop health and yield.
